# Cosmwasm Examples

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/terra-project/cosmwasm-contracts/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/terra-project/cosmwasm-contracts/tree/master)

This repo is a collection of contracts built with the
[cosmwasm](https://github.com/confio/cosmwasm) framework.
Anyone building on cosmwasm is encouraged to submit their contracts
as a sub-project via a PR.

The organization is relatively simple. The top-level directory is just a placeholder
and has no real code. And we use workspaces to add multiple contracts below.
This allows us to compile all contracts with one command.

## Usage:

The following contracts are available for use. You can view the source code under `src`
and a precompiled wasm ready for deployment under `contract.wasm`. Take a look here:

* [escrow](./cosmwasm-examples/escrow) - A basic escrow with timeout and partial release
* [erc20](./cosmwasm-examples/erc20) - Basic implementation the erc20 interface for CosmWasm, as a base for token designers
* [maker](./contracts/maker) - Example implementation to show terra-binding for CosmWasm

## Development

### Starting a contract

If you want to add a contract, first fork this repo and create a branch for your PR.
I suggest setting it up via [cosmwasm-template](https://github.com/confio/cosmwasm-template):

`cargo generate --git https://github.com/confio/cosmwasm-template.git --name FOO`

Then update the `README.md` to reflect your actual contract (just read the `README.md` in the autogenerated
template - it explains a lot).

### Preparing for merge

Before you merge the code, make sure it builds and passes all tests, both in the package,
and when calling it from the root packages `cargo wasm && cargo test`. This should
show your package is covered by the CI.

There is also quite some useful information in `Development.md` and `Publishing.md` in the newly generated
contract.

You should also prepare a compiled `contract.wasm` before each merge to master.
This is not enforced by the CI (a full build each commit), but should be tested
on merge. See [`cosmwasm-opt`](https://github.com/confio/cosmwasm-opt/blob/master/README.md#usage)
for an explanation of how to make a deterministic build.

```sh
rm contract.wasm
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code \
  --mount type=volume,source=$(basename $(pwd))_cache,target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  confio/cosmwasm-opt:0.9.0

# verify output - these should be the same
sha256sum contract.wasm
cat hash.txt
```

If the sha256 hash changes without any code changes, even when compiling on different machines,
or removing those cache volumes, then please submit an issue on [cosmwasm-opt](https://github.com/confio/cosmwasm-opt).

Once you pass these checks, please open a [PR on this repo](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-examples/pulls).
